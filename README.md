# Heart_Failure_Prediction
-This model is built by using Logistic Regression where the dataset is Trained.                                                   

-In this dataset there are different types of columns including age,anaemia,creatinine_phosphokinase,ejection_fraction,high_blood_pressure,ejection_fraction,high_blood_pressure,platelets,serum_creatinine,serum_sodium,sex,smoking,time,DEATH_EVENT.

-With these columns as the source of data the model is trained.

-the accuracy of this model is around 85%ðŸ‘Œ.
